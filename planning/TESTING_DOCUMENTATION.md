# Testing Documentation: SC Food Truck Finder

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy, types of tests, procedures, and quality assurance measures for the SC Food Truck Finder application. The goal is to ensure the application is reliable, functional, performant, and provides a good user experience.

This document will be updated as the project evolves and new features are added.

## 2. Testing Strategy

*   **Continuous Testing:** Testing will be an integral part of the development lifecycle, not an afterthought.
*   **Phased Approach:** Testing efforts will align with the development phases (MVP, Post-Launch Enhancements, Advanced Features).
*   **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing efforts on high-risk areas, critical functionalities, and frequently used features.
*   **Automation Where Feasible:** Automate repetitive tests (unit, integration) to improve efficiency and coverage. Manual testing will be used for exploratory, usability, and UI/UX validation.
*   **Developer Responsibility:** Developers are responsible for unit testing their code.
*   **Dedicated Testing Cycles:** Specific time will be allocated for more comprehensive integration, system, and user acceptance testing before major releases or phase completions.

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1. Unit Testing

*   **Purpose:** To verify individual components or functions of the code in isolation.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Frontend: React components (props, state, rendering), utility functions.
    *   Backend: Firebase Functions (individual logic units, data transformations), helper modules.
    *   AI Parsing Logic: Functions responsible for validating LLM output, transforming data structures.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library.
    *   Backend: Jest, Firebase Test SDK (for emulating Firebase services).
*   **Metrics:** Aim for a reasonable code coverage percentage for critical modules.

### 3.2. Integration Testing

*   **Purpose:** To verify the interaction between different components or modules of the system.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Frontend-Backend: API calls from React components to Firebase Functions (e.g., fetching truck data, submitting suggestions).
    *   Service Integrations: Interactions with Firebase services (Auth, Firestore, Scheduled Functions).
    *   AI/LLM Integration: The end-to-end flow of sending data to an LLM, receiving a response, parsing it, and storing/displaying it.
    *   External API Integrations (Future): e.g., Google Maps Platform, Yelp.
*   **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library (for frontend flows), Postman/Insomnia (for API endpoint testing), Firebase Test SDK.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing / UI Testing

*   **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and verify the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Key user journeys:
        *   Searching and filtering food trucks.
        *   Viewing truck details.
        *   User registration and login.
        *   Favoriting a truck.
        *   Submitting a new truck or reporting an issue.
    *   Responsive design across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
*   **Tools:**
    *   Manual: Browser developer tools, physical devices/emulators.
    *   Automated (Consider for critical flows post-MVP): Cypress, Playwright.
*   **Focus:** Validating UI elements, navigation, data display, and overall user experience.

### 3.4. AI/LLM Output Validation Testing

*   **Purpose:** Specifically test the accuracy, reliability, and format correctness of data parsed by LLMs.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Parsing various unstructured text inputs (simulating social media posts, event descriptions).
    *   Validating output against expected JSON/YAML schema.
    *   Testing the linter feedback loop (PRD Section 6).
    *   Accuracy of extracted fields (date, time, location, event name).
    *   Handling of ambiguous or incomplete input data.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Create a diverse dataset of sample inputs and their expected structured outputs.
    *   Automated scripts to send inputs to the LLM parsing module and compare results against expected outputs.
    *   Manual review of edge cases and LLM responses that fail validation.

### 3.5. Performance Testing

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the application meets performance requirements (loading times, responsiveness).
*   **Scope:**
    *   Frontend: Page load speed (Lighthouse, WebPageTest), map interaction smoothness, list scrolling performance.
    *   Backend: Firebase Function execution time, Firestore query performance.
*   **Tools:** Browser developer tools (Network, Performance tabs), Google Lighthouse, WebPageTest.io.
*   **Metrics:** As defined in PRD Section 5 (e.g., <3 seconds load time).

### 3.6. Usability Testing

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate how easy and intuitive the application is to use.
*   **Scope:** Navigation, clarity of UI elements, task completion efficiency, overall user satisfaction.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Informal walkthroughs with target users (or peers acting as users).
    *   Observing users performing common tasks.
    *   Gathering feedback on UI/UX design.

### 3.7. Accessibility Testing

*   **Purpose:** To ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
*   **Scope:** Adherence to basic WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
    *   Keyboard navigation.
    *   Sufficient color contrast.
    *   Screen reader compatibility (basic checks).
    *   Proper use of ARIA attributes where necessary.
*   **Tools:** Browser accessibility checkers (e.g., Lighthouse, Axe DevTools), manual keyboard testing.

### 3.8. Security Testing

*   **Purpose:** To identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Authentication and authorization mechanisms (Firebase Auth).
    *   Firestore security rules.
    *   Input validation (to prevent XSS, injection attacks).
    *   API key management (ensuring keys are not exposed client-side).
    *   HTTPS enforcement.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Code reviews focused on security aspects.
    *   Review of Firebase security rules.
    *   Use of security linters/scanners if applicable.
    *   Manual checks for common web vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10 relevant items).

## 4. Test Environment

*   **Local Development:** Developers test on their local machines, using emulators for Firebase services.
*   **Staging/Preview Environment:** Vercel preview deployments will be used for integration testing and UAT before merging to main/production.
*   **Production Environment:** Final smoke testing after deployment.

## 5. Test Case Management

*   **Format:** Test cases will be documented with:
    *   Test Case ID
    *   Feature/Module
    *   Test Objective/Description
    *   Preconditions
    *   Test Steps
    *   Expected Result
    *   Actual Result
