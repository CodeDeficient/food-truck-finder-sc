# Progress Tracker Plan: SC Food Truck Finder

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for tracking the progress of the SC Food Truck Finder project. A systematic approach to progress tracking is essential for ensuring the project stays on schedule, resources are managed effectively, and stakeholders are informed.

## 2. Goals of Progress Tracking

*   Provide visibility into the current status of tasks, features, and phases.
*   Identify potential delays or roadblocks early.
*   Facilitate communication among team members (initially the primary developer, potentially future collaborators).
*   Ensure alignment with the overall project timeline and milestones defined in the PRD and `planning_phase_plan.md`.
*   Measure velocity and help in future estimations.

## 3. Tracking Methodology & Tools

### 3.1. Task Breakdown

*   Tasks will be derived from the `tasks/development_wbs.md` (Work Breakdown Structure), which itself is based on the PRD features and phases.
*   Larger tasks (Epics/Features) will be broken down into smaller, manageable user stories or technical tasks.

### 3.2. Tracking Tool

*   **Initial Phase (Solo Developer):**
    *   A simple Markdown-based system within this repository can be used. This could involve:
        *   A main `PROGRESS_OVERVIEW.md` file linking to phase-specific progress.
        *   Checklists within `development_wbs.md` or separate task list files.
    *   **Example Structure for a Task in Markdown:**
        ```markdown
        - [ ] Task ID: T001
          - Description: Implement user login with Firebase Auth.
          - Priority: High
          - Estimated Effort: 2 days
          - Status: To Do / In Progress / Blocked / Done
          - Assignee: Daniel
          - Start Date: YYYY-MM-DD
          - End Date (Actual/Projected): YYYY-MM-DD
          - Notes: Depends on Firebase project setup.
        ```
*   **Future (If team expands or complexity increases):**
    *   Consider using a dedicated project management tool like:
        *   **GitHub Projects:** Integrates well with the repository, offers Kanban boards.
        *   **Trello:** Simple Kanban board interface.
        *   **Jira:** More comprehensive, suitable for larger, more complex projects.
        *   **Taskade:** AI-powered task management (as mentioned in Grok 3 research).

### 3.3. Status Categories

*   **To Do:** Task has been identified but not yet started.
*   **In Progress:** Task is actively being worked on.
*   **Blocked:** Task cannot proceed due to a dependency or issue. (Reason for blockage should be noted).
*   **In Review:** Task is completed and awaiting review (e.g., code review, QA).
*   **Done:** Task is completed, reviewed, and meets acceptance criteria (Definition of Done).
*   **Deferred:** Task has been postponed to a later phase or release.

## 4. Reporting and Cadence

### 4.1. Daily Stand-ups (Self-Reflection for Solo Developer)

*   What did I accomplish yesterday?
*   What will I work on today?
*   Are there any blockers?

This can be a mental check or a brief note in a personal log.

### 4.2. Weekly Review

*   Review overall progress against the `planning_phase_plan.md` and `development_wbs.md`.
*   Update task statuses.
*   Identify any tasks falling behind schedule.
*   Adjust priorities if necessary.
*   Update the `PROGRESS_OVERVIEW.md` or chosen tracking tool.

### 4.3. Phase/Milestone Review

*   At the end of each phase (MVP, etc.) or major milestone:
    *   Conduct a thorough review of all completed tasks.
    *   Ensure all "Definition of Done" criteria are met for the phase.
    *   Document lessons learned.
    *   Plan for the next phase.

## 5. Key Metrics (Optional, more relevant for larger teams/later stages)

*   **Task Completion Rate:** Percentage of tasks completed within a sprint or phase.
*   **Velocity:** Amount of work (e.g., story points, number of tasks) completed per iteration.
*   **Cycle Time:** Time taken from starting a task to its completion.
*   **Burn-down/Burn-up Charts:** Visual representation of work remaining or completed over time.

## 6. Progress Tracker Document Structure (If using Markdown)

*   `planning/PROGRESS_OVERVIEW.md`: High-level summary, links to detailed phase trackers.
*   `planning/PHASE_1_MVP_PROGRESS.md`: Detailed task list and status for MVP.
*   `planning/PHASE_2_ENHANCEMENTS_PROGRESS.md`: For post-launch enhancements.
*   (etc. for other phases)

Each phase progress document would contain lists of features/tasks with their current status, assignee (if applicable), and notes.

## 7. Responsibilities

*   **Primary Developer (Daniel):** Responsible for maintaining and updating the progress tracker, especially in the initial solo development phase.

## 8. Tools and Templates

*   Task checklist template (as shown in 3.2).
*   Link to `planning/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md` for acceptance criteria.

## 9. Revision History

*   YYYY-MM-DD: Initial draft.
