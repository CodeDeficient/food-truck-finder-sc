# SC Food Truck Finder - Development Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

This document provides a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the implementation phase of the SC Food Truck Finder web application. Phase 1 (MVP) will focus on migrating an existing HTML/CSS/JS prototype (`index.html`) into a robust Next.js application, enhancing it with a proper component structure, state management, and backend foundations. This WBS is derived from the `planning/planning_phase_plan.md` and `prd.txt`. Each task includes a checklist placeholder for tracking completion.

    1.1.4.1.  [ ] : Review existing styles in `index.html` and categorize them: (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        1.1.4.1.1. [ ] : Identify truly global styles (e.g., base body styles, global typography, some layout resets not covered by Tailwind Preflight).
        1.1.4.1.2. [ ] : Identify component-specific styles (e.g., styles for `.truck-card`, `.filter-button`).
        1.1.4.1.3. [ ] : Identify utility-like styles that could be replaced by Tailwind utilities.
    1.1.4.2.  [ ] : Plan CSS load order and specificity management strategy. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)

        1.1.4.2.2. [ ] : Ensure Tailwind's directives (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`) are correctly placed in `globals.css` (typically at the top) to allow custom global styles to override or extend them if necessary.
        1.1.4.2.3. [ ] : For component-specific styles, plan to use CSS Modules (`.module.css`) to avoid class name collisions and scope styles locally.
        1.1.4.2.4. [ ] : If custom global styles need to override Tailwind utilities in specific, rare cases, consider using higher specificity selectors or custom Tailwind layers (e.g. `@layer customGlobal`). Use `!important` as a last resort and document its use.
    1.1.4.3.  [ ] : Migrate global styles to `src/app/globals.css`. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        1.1.4.3.1. [ ] : Transfer `body` styles, verify against Tailwind's Preflight, and resolve conflicts (e.g., by removing redundant styles or adjusting custom styles to complement Preflight).
        1.1.4.3.2. [ ] : Transfer custom scrollbar styles and any other truly global utility classes (e.g., SVG helper classes if broadly used).
    1.1.4.4.  [ ] : Iteratively migrate component-specific styles: For each component identified in Task 1.2 (e.g., `FoodTruckCardComponent`, `FilterButtonComponent`): (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 5/10 - Repetitive but requires care for each component)
        1.1.4.4.1. [ ] : Create a corresponding CSS Module file (e.g., `FoodTruckCard.module.css`).

        1.1.4.4.3. [ ] : Import and use these module styles in the respective React component.
        1.1.4.4.4. [ ] : During this transfer, actively refactor styles to use Tailwind utility classes where a direct 1-to-1 or simple combination of utilities can achieve the same result. Document styles that are too complex for immediate refactoring.
        1.1.4.4.5. [ ] : Verify styling and resolve any conflicts with Tailwind utilities or global styles. Test responsiveness.
    1.1.4.5.  [ ] : Specifically address `.glass-panel` styles: (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        1.1.4.5.1. [ ] : Determine if `.glass-panel` is a global utility or component-specific. If global, consider adding its definition to `globals.css` (potentially under `@layer components` if it's a common pattern). If mostly tied to cards, it might go into `FoodTruckCard.module.css` or a shared card style module.
        1.1.4.5.2. [ ] : Migrate its styles, including the pseudo-element, ensuring it works with Tailwind.
    1.1.4.6.  [ ] : Specifically address `#map` styles: (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        1.1.4.6.1. [ ] : These are likely specific to the `MapDisplayComponent`. Migrate to `MapDisplay.module.css` or apply inline if very simple and dynamic.
    1.1.4.7.  [ ] : Ensure Tailwind's JIT engine correctly scans all files for utility classes by verifying `tailwind.config.js` `content` paths (e.g., `['./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', './src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}']`). (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 1/10)
    1.1.4.8.  [ ] : Document any complex custom CSS that remains, the rationale for keeping it, and any potential future refactoring opportunities. (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
1.1.5. [ ] **Action:** Create Tailwind utility classes or components for consistent rounded corners and shadows (leveraging findings from CSS migration, potentially using `@apply` in `globals.css` or a base component style). (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 4/10 - May involve creating custom Tailwind plugins or higher-order components, or defining reusable classes with `@apply`)

        12.2.1.2.1. [ ] : Store API keys in Firebase Function environment configuration (e.g., `functions.config().service.api_key` for 1st gen, or use Secret Manager for 2nd gen Functions).
        12.2.1.2.2. [ ] : Restrict API key usage in the respective cloud console if possible (e.g., by HTTP referrer for client-side keys if any, or by IP for server-side keys if supported by provider, though less common for server-to-server).
    12.2.1.3. [ ] : Develop a Firebase Callable Function to act as a proxy for API calls. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 5/10)
        12.2.1.3.1. [ ] : Define clear input parameters for the callable function (e.g., `{ truckId: string, truckName: string, truckAddressHint?: string, truckLat?: number, truckLng?: number }`).
        12.2.1.3.2. [ ] : Implement logic within the function to construct the appropriate external API request (e.g., search by name and location hint).
        12.2.1.3.3. [ ] : Call the external API using an HTTP client (e.g., `axios` or `node-fetch`) with the securely stored API key in headers/params as required by the provider.
        12.2.1.3.4. [ ] : Transform the raw API response: Parse the JSON, extract only necessary fields (e.g., `averageRating`, `reviewCount`, `photoReferences`, a few top review snippets), and map them to a consistent internal data structure.
        12.2.1.3.5. [ ] : Implement robust error handling:
            12.2.1.3.5.1. [ ] : Catch errors from the external API call (network issues, 4xx/5xx status codes).
            12.2.1.3.5.2. [ ] : Handle cases where no matching business is found.
            12.2.1.3.5.3. [ ] : Return meaningful error objects to the client (e.g., `{ error: true, code: 'not-found', message: '...' }`).
    12.2.1.4. [ ] : Implement a caching strategy for API responses within the Callable Function using Firestore. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        12.2.1.4.1. [ ] : Create a Firestore collection (e.g., `external_api_cache`).
        12.2.1.4.2. [ ] : Use a unique identifier for cache documents (e.g., `google_places_${truckId}` or a hash of query parameters).
        12.2.1.4.3. [ ] : Store the transformed API response and a `cachedAt: serverTimestamp()` field in the cache document.
        12.2.1.4.4. [ ] : Define a TTL (e.g., 24 hours). Before making an external API call, query Firestore for a document with the unique ID where `cachedAt` is within the TTL.
        12.2.1.4.5. [ ] : If a fresh cache entry exists, return its data. Otherwise, call the external API, store the (transformed) result in the cache with the current timestamp, then return the result.
    12.2.1.5. [ ] : Implement UI on the Truck Detail Screen (and potentially `FoodTruckCardComponent`) to display fetched ratings/reviews. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)

### 14. SEO & AI Search Optimization (Advanced) (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 7/10 - Requires understanding of SEO best practices, Next.js rendering, and structured data)
14.0. [ ] **Umbrella Task:** Oversee SEO and AI Search Optimization efforts. (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 3/10 - Coordination and strategy)

**14.1. SSR/SSG Implementation** (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 6/10 - Correctly implementing Next.js data fetching and rendering strategies for optimal SEO and performance)
14.1.1. [ ] **Action:** Strategically leverage Next.js rendering capabilities (SSG, SSR, ISR using App Router features) for optimal SEO and performance. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 6/10)
    14.1.1.1. [ ] : Identify and categorize pages for appropriate rendering strategies. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        14.1.1.1.1. [ ] : Purely static content pages (e.g., "About Us", "Privacy Policy", `/legal/[slug]`):
            14.1.1.1.1.1. [ ] : Target for SSG. Use default `fetch` (which is `cache: 'force-cache'`) in Server Components.
            14.1.1.1.1.2. [ ] : If segments are dynamic but known at build time (e.g., `/legal/[slug]`), use `generateStaticParams` to provide the `slug` values.
        14.1.1.1.2. [ ] : Truck detail pages (`/trucks/{truckId}`):
            14.1.1.1.2.1. [ ] : Target for ISR. Use `fetch` with `next: { revalidate: <seconds> }` (e.g., `3600` for 1 hour) in the Server Component for the page.
            14.1.1.1.2.2. [ ] : Optionally, use `generateStaticParams` to pre-render a subset of popular truck pages at build time. Set `export const dynamicParams = true;` to allow on-demand server-rendering for new/un-generated `truckId`s, which will then be cached for ISR.
        14.1.1.1.3. [ ] : Main list/map view page (`/` or `/trucks`):
            14.1.1.1.3.1. [ ] : For initial SEO & perceived performance: Consider ISR for a shell or a small, representative subset of data (e.g., first 10 trucks) using `fetch` with `next: { revalidate: <seconds> }`.
            14.1.1.1.3.2. [ ] : Alternatively, if data must be absolutely live on first load (less common for a list view), use SSR with `fetch` and `cache: 'no-store'`.
            14.1.1.1.3.3. [ ] : Subsequent filtering, searching, and loading more items will be handled client-side (CSR).
    14.1.1.2. [ ] : Implement data fetching in Server Components using `async/await` with `fetch`. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 5/10)
        14.1.1.2.1. [ ] : For SSG (default): `const data = await fetch('api/static-content');` (implicitly `cache: 'force-cache'`).
        14.1.1.2.2. [ ] : For ISR: `const data = await fetch('api/trucks/${id}', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } });`
        14.1.1.2.3. [ ] : For SSR: `const data = await fetch('api/live-data', { cache: 'no-store' });`
    14.1.1.3. [ ] : Implement `generateStaticParams` for dynamic routes intended for SSG or build-time ISR.
        14.1.1.3.1. [ ] : Example for `/trucks/[id]`: `export async function generateStaticParams() { const trucks = await fetch('.../trucks-ids').then(res => res.json()); return trucks.map(truck => ({ id: truck.id })); }`
    14.1.1.4. [ ] : Implement dynamic metadata generation using `generateMetadata` for relevant pages. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        14.1.1.4.1. [ ] : `export async function generateMetadata({ params }) { const item = await fetch('api/item/${params.id}').then(res => res.json()); return { title: item.title, description: item.description }; }`
        14.1.1.4.2. [ ] : Ensure `fetch` calls within `generateMetadata` use appropriate caching (default `force-cache` is usually fine as metadata is often tied to build-time or revalidated data).
    14.1.1.5. [ ] : Test and verify rendering strategies. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
        14.1.1.5.1. [ ] : Inspect Next.js build output logs to confirm which pages are statically generated (SSG/ISR at build).
        14.1.1.5.2. [ ] : Use browser developer tools (Network tab, response headers like `Cache-Control`, `X-Vercel-Cache`) to check caching behavior for ISR/SSR pages.
        14.1.1.5.3. [ ] : View page source to confirm pre-rendered content for SEO.
    14.1.1.6. [ ] : Monitor build times and server load (for SSR/ISR) as content grows, and adjust revalidation periods or `generateStaticParams` strategies if needed. (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 2/10)

14.2.1. [ ] **Action:** Implement Schema.org structured data markup (JSON-LD) for relevant page types to enhance SEO. (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 7/10 - Requires careful schema selection, dynamic data population, and validation)
    14.2.1.1. [ ] : Research and define appropriate Schema.org types and properties. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        14.2.1.1.1. [ ] : For Individual Food Truck pages: Use `FoodEstablishment` (or `Restaurant`). Key properties: `name`, `address` (with `streetAddress`, `addressLocality`, `addressRegion`, `postalCode`), `geo` (`GeoCoordinates` with `latitude`, `longitude`), `telephone`, `image` (URL), `servesCuisine`, `menu` (URL to menu if available), `openingHoursSpecification` (`OpeningHoursSpecification` objects).
        14.2.1.1.2. [ ] : For Food Truck schedule/events: Use `Event`. Key properties: `name` (e.g., "Truck X at Location Y"), `startDate`, `endDate` (ISO 8601 format), `location` (as a `Place` schema with `name`, `address`, `geo`), `organizer` (linking to the `FoodEstablishment`). Can be embedded within `FoodEstablishment` or as separate linked entities.
        14.2.1.1.3. [ ] : For Main list pages (e.g., search results, category pages): Use `ItemList`. Key properties: `itemListElement` (an array of `ListItem` objects, where each `ListItem` references a `FoodEstablishment` by URL or contains a summarized `FoodEstablishment` object).
    14.2.1.2. [ ] : Develop a reusable React Server Component (e.g., `JsonLdScript.tsx`) to generate and inject JSON-LD `<script>` tags. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        14.2.1.2.1. [ ] : Component should accept a schema object (or array of objects) as a prop.
        14.2.1.2.2. [ ] : Use `schema-dts` for TypeScript typings of schema objects to ensure correctness.
        14.2.1.2.3. [ ] : Render `<script type="application/ld+json" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: JSON.stringify(schema) }} />`. Place this component within the `<body>` of relevant `page.tsx` files.
    14.2.1.3. [ ] : Implement dynamic JSON-LD generation in Server Components for page types:
        14.2.1.3.1. [ ] : Individual Food Truck pages (`/trucks/[id]/page.tsx`): Fetch truck data, construct the `FoodEstablishment` schema object (including `Event` schemas for its schedule if applicable), and pass to `JsonLdScript` component. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 5/10)
        14.2.1.3.2. [ ] : Main list/map view page: Fetch list of trucks, construct an `ItemList` schema where each `itemListElement` contains a summarized `FoodEstablishment` (name, URL, image, short description), and pass to `JsonLdScript`. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
    14.2.1.4. [ ] : Validate all JSON-LD implementations. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10 - Crucial testing step)
        14.2.1.4.1. [ ] : Use Google's Rich Results Test for pages intended for rich snippets.
        14.2.1.4.2. [ ] : Use the Schema Markup Validator (validator.schema.org) for general schema validation.
14.2.2. [ ] : Monitor structured data in Google Search Console for errors or warnings after deployment. (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 1/10)
14.2.3. [ ] **Action:** Optimize dynamic titles, meta descriptions, and Open Graph (OG) tags using Next.js `generateMetadata` function. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
    14.2.3.1. [ ] : For dynamic pages (e.g., truck detail pages), implement `export async function generateMetadata({ params })` in `page.tsx`.
    14.2.3.2. [ ] : Fetch necessary data within `generateMetadata` (e.g., truck name, description, main image) using `fetch` with appropriate caching.
    14.2.3.3. [ ] : Return an object with `title`, `description`, and `openGraph` properties (including `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:type`, `og:url`).
    14.2.3.4. [ ] : Ensure unique and descriptive metadata for each page type.
    14.2.3.5. [ ] : Test metadata using browser developer tools and social media sharing debuggers (e.g., Facebook Sharing Debugger, Twitter Card Validator).

**15.3. Live Updates Strategy (Over-the-Air - OTA)** (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 7/10 - Implementing or integrating a live update mechanism for web assets, ensuring security and reliability)
15.3.1. [ ] **Action:** Investigate and select a live update (OTA) solution for pushing web asset updates to deployed Capacitor apps. (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 4/10 - Researching options, comparing features, pricing, and ease of integration)
    15.3.1.1. [ ] : Prioritize Capgo (`@capgo/capacitor-updater`) as the primary candidate due to its Capacitor-native focus, open-source server option, features (encryption, channels, CI/CD integration), and positive community feedback as an alternative to Ionic Appflow.
    15.3.1.2. [ ] : Review Capgo's pricing (free tier, paid plans), security features (end-to-end encryption), and detailed integration steps from their documentation.
    15.3.1.3. [ ] : Briefly note Ionic Appflow as a more enterprise-focused, potentially more expensive option, and that its live update feature is a core offering.
    15.3.1.4. [ ] : Note self-hosting a CodePush fork as a high-complexity alternative if managed services are not viable.
    15.3.1.5. [ ] : Document the chosen solution (likely Capgo) and rationale.
15.3.2. [ ] **Action:** Plan the integration of Capgo for OTA updates. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 5/10 - SDK integration, build pipeline adjustments, update strategy)
    15.3.2.1. [ ] : SDK Integration: Plan to install `@capgo/capacitor-updater` (plugin) and `@capgo/cli` (for uploading bundles).
    15.3.2.2. [ ] : Update Check: Configure the app to check for updates on app start using Capgo SDK methods (e.g., `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` and automatic checks, or manual `CapacitorUpdater.download()` flow).
    15.3.2.3. [ ] : Build Process for Update Bundles:
        15.3.2.3.1. [ ] : The update bundle will consist of the static web assets generated by `next build` (typically in the `out` directory).
        15.3.2.3.2. [ ] : Use `@capgo/cli bundle build` (if needed) and `@capgo/cli bundle upload --channel <channel_name>` to upload the `out` directory to the Capgo service.
        15.3.2.3.3. [ ] : Plan to integrate this upload step into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run after a successful web asset build for specific branches/tags.
    15.3.2.4. [ ] : Update Strategy:
        15.3.2.4.1. [ ] : Default to silent updates (Capgo's default behavior) for minor fixes and content changes.

    15.3.2.6. [ ] : Document the Capgo setup process, API key management (if any for CLI), CI/CD integration steps, and the update deployment workflow.
    15.3.2.7. [ ] : Remember that OTA updates only apply to web assets. Native code changes (plugins, custom native code) still require a new app store submission.
15.3.3. [ ] **Action:** (Potentially Post-MVP or if time allows) Implement basic integration of Capgo. (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 6/10 - Involves SDK setup, manual test cycle, error handling considerations, and initial CI planning)
    15.3.3.1. [ ] **: Initial Setup & Configuration (Capgo)** (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        15.3.3.1.1. [ ] : Install `@capgo/capacitor-updater` (plugin) and `@capgo/cli` (as a dev dependency). Ensure versions are compatible with the project's Capacitor core and other relevant plugins. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
        15.3.3.1.2. [ ] : Set up a Capgo account and create an app instance on their cloud service. Securely store any API keys/tokens provided by Capgo (e.g., for CLI usage) using the project's agreed-upon secret management strategy (e.g., GitHub secrets for CI, local environment variables for manual CLI use). (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
        15.3.3.1.3. [ ] : Configure the Capgo plugin within the Capacitor application according to the official Capgo documentation (this might involve settings in `capacitor.config.ts`, or modifications to native app delegate files like `MainActivity.java` or `AppDelegate.swift`). (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        15.3.3.1.4. [ ] : Implement the initial update check logic within the app (e.g., on app startup using `CapacitorUpdater.notifyAppReady()` for automatic checks, or by implementing a manual check flow triggered by user action or specific app events). (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
        15.3.3.1.5. [ ] : Research and consider implementing configurable delays for update checks, as suggested by Capgo best practices, to optimize app startup performance. Document decision. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)

            15.3.3.2.1.1. [ ] : Confirm the Next.js application is correctly configured for static export (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`).
            15.3.3.2.1.2. [ ] : Ensure all dynamic routes intended for static export have `generateStaticParams` implemented.
            15.3.3.2.1.3. [ ] : Execute the Next.js build command (e.g., `bun run build`) to generate the static assets in the `out` directory.
        15.3.3.2.2. [ ] : Perform an initial manual upload of the generated `out` directory to a designated Capgo `develop` (or other non-production) channel using the `@capgo/cli bundle upload --channel develop` command. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
        15.3.3.2.3. [ ] : Build and run the Capacitor application (with the Capgo plugin integrated) on an Android emulator or physical device. This build should contain the web assets *before* the update.
        15.3.3.2.4. [ ] : Make a small, easily verifiable visual change to a web asset within the Next.js project (e.g., update text content in a prominent component, change a color).
        15.3.3.2.5. [ ] : Re-build the Next.js static assets to include this change.
        15.3.3.2.6. [ ] : Upload this new `out` directory as an update to the same Capgo `develop` channel using the CLI.
        15.3.3.2.7. [ ] : Test the end-to-end OTA update flow:
            15.3.3.2.7.1. [ ] : Close and reopen the application on the test device/emulator.
            15.3.3.2.7.2. [ ] : Verify that the app detects, downloads, and applies the update. Confirm the visual change is visible.
            15.3.3.2.7.3. [ ] : Check the Capgo dashboard (if available) and any client-side logs for status updates or errors related to the update process.
    15.3.3.3. [ ] **: Basic Error Handling & Fallback Considerations** (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        15.3.3.3.1. [ ] : Implement basic error handling for the Capgo update process within the app. This should include logging errors and potentially notifying the user if an update fails critically, while ensuring the app remains functional with the currently installed bundle. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        15.3.3.3.2. [ ] : Review Capgo documentation regarding its handling of native code changes. Confirm that OTA updates are restricted to web assets and that there are safeguards or warnings if native changes are inadvertently included in an update bundle. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
    15.3.3.4. [ ] **: Documentation & CI/CD Planning (Initial)** (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        15.3.3.4.1. [ ] : Document the manual Capgo setup, build, and upload process, including CLI commands used and Capgo channel strategy.
        15.3.3.4.2. [ ] : (If time allows within Post-MVP scope) Begin outlining the steps to integrate the `@capgo/cli bundle upload` command into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for the `develop` branch.
            15.3.3.4.2.1. [ ] : Identify necessary CI steps: checkout code, setup Node/Bun, install dependencies, build Next.js static assets, then upload the `out` directory to the appropriate Capgo channel.
            15.3.3.4.2.2. [ ] : Plan for secure storage and usage of the Capgo CLI token within the CI environment.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Monetization (Future) - Placeholder (Risk: 8/10 - High complexity, business validation, new large features) (Complexity: 8/10 - Significant new feature sets with business and technical challenges)
P3.0. [ ] **Umbrella Task:** Oversee Phase 3 development. (Risk: 8/10) (Complexity: 3/10 - High-level coordination of complex phase)

        16.1.2.2. [ ] : Develop a secure mechanism (e.g., an admin-triggered Cloud Function, or a verified sign-up process for owners) to set this custom claim on designated user accounts using the Firebase Admin SDK.
        16.1.2.3. [ ] : Client-side (owner portal) logic to check for this claim in the user's ID token to grant access to portal features.
        16.1.2.4. [ ] : Update Firestore security rules to leverage this custom claim for owner-specific data access (e.g., only an owner can write to their truck's profile).
        16.1.2.5. [ ] : Be aware of ID token caching (up to 1 hour) and its effect on claim propagation.
    16.1.3. [ ] : Design UI/UX for the owner dashboard and management sections (profile, schedule, menu). (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
    16.1.4. [ ] : Implement basic dashboard layout and navigation for the owner portal. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)

    17.1.1. [ ] : Set up a Plausible Analytics account and configure the domain. (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 1/10)
    17.1.2. [ ] : Integrate Plausible into the Next.js app (e.g., using `next-plausible` package or manually adding script) for basic pageview tracking. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
    17.1.3. [ ] : Define and implement 3-5 key custom event tracking goals in Plausible to measure meaningful user interactions, leveraging `next-plausible`. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 5/10 - Requires careful event definition, implementation using `usePlausible` hook, dashboard goal configuration, and thorough testing)
        17.1.3.1. [ ] : Confirm `PlausibleProvider` from `next-plausible` is correctly set up in the root layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`). (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 1/10 - Prerequisite check)
        17.1.3.2. [ ] : Identify 3-5 key user interactions for custom event tracking. Examples:
            *   `TruckFavorited`: When a user favorites/unfavorites a truck. Props: `{ truckId: string, favorited: boolean }`.
            *   `FilterApplied`: When a user applies a filter. Props: `{ filterType: string, filterValue: string }` (e.g., `{ filterType: 'cuisine', filterValue: 'Mexican' }`).
            *   `DirectionsClicked`: When a user clicks a "get directions" link/button. Props: `{ truckId: string, truckName: string }`.
            *   `ShareClicked`: When a user clicks a share button. Props: `{ truckId?: string, pageUrl: string }`.
            *   `OutboundLinkClick`: For clicks on external links (e.g., truck's website). Props: `{ url: string, linkContext: string }` (e.g., `linkContext: 'truck_card_website_link'`).
            *   (Consider) `SearchPerformed`: When a user executes a search. Props: `{ searchTerm: string, resultCount: number }`.
        17.1.3.3. [ ] : For each identified custom event:
            17.1.3.3.1. [ ] : Define a clear event name (e.g., `TruckFavorited`, `ApplyFilter`).
            17.1.3.3.2. [ ] : Define relevant custom properties (props) to send with the event for detailed analysis. Keep props concise and meaningful.
            17.1.3.3.3. [ ] : (Optional but recommended) If using TypeScript, define types for custom event names and their props for type safety, as shown in `next-plausible` documentation.
        17.1.3.4. [ ] : Implement custom event tracking in the relevant React components or event handlers using the `usePlausible` hook. (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
            17.1.3.4.1. [ ] : Example: `const plausible = usePlausible(); plausible('TruckFavorited', { props: { truckId: '123', favorited: true } });`
            17.1.3.4.2. [ ] : For form submissions (if any are tracked as custom events, e.g., a newsletter signup form), ensure tracking is robust. Plausible docs suggest tagging the `<form>` element itself (e.g., `plausible-event-name="NewsletterSignup"`) if the form submission causes navigation, to ensure the event is sent. Alternatively, trigger the event via `usePlausible` in the form's `onSubmit` handler *before* navigation or submission logic that might interrupt the event.
        17.1.3.5. [ ] : In the Plausible Analytics dashboard:
            17.1.3.5.1. [ ] : Ensure "Custom events" feature is enabled for the site under settings.
            17.1.3.5.2. [ ] : For each custom event name implemented, configure it as a "Goal" in the "Goal Conversions" section of the Plausible dashboard.

            17.1.3.6.2. [ ] : Verify that the event and its associated props appear correctly in the Plausible dashboard (may take a few minutes to show up).
            17.1.3.6.3. [ ] : Check browser console for any errors related to Plausible event tracking.
            17.1.3.6.4. [ ] : If using `trackLocalhost` with `next-plausible` for development, verify events on localhost. Otherwise, test on a staging/preview deployment.
        17.1.3.7. [ ] : Document the implemented custom events, their props, and corresponding Goal names in Plausible. (Risk: 2/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
17.2. [ ] **Action:** Develop custom dashboards or reports if Plausible's default dashboard and goal tracking are insufficient for key performance indicators (KPIs). (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 7/10 - Involves API integration, data processing, and visualization if custom solution is built)
    17.2.1. [ ] : Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for the application (e.g., user engagement, feature adoption, conversion rates for key actions like favoriting or getting directions). (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        17.2.1.1. [ ] : Examples: Daily/Monthly Active Users, Top Viewed Trucks, Filter Usage Frequency, Favorite Action Rate, Directions Click Rate.
    17.2.2. [ ] : Evaluate if Plausible's default dashboard and configured custom event goals adequately represent these KPIs. (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
    17.2.3. [ ] : If custom reporting is needed:
        17.2.3.1. [ ] : Research and understand the Plausible Stats API for data extraction, including available endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/stats/aggregate`, `/api/v1/stats/timeseries`, `/api/v1/stats/breakdown`), query parameters (e.g., `site_id`, `period`, `metrics`, `filters`, `property`), and authentication (API key in header). (Risk: 4/10) (Complexity: 3/10)
        17.2.3.2. [ ] : Plan the structure and visualizations for the custom report/dashboard. (Risk: 5/10) (Complexity: 4/10)
            17.2.3.2.1. [ ] : Identify 1-2 key KPIs not well covered by Plausible's default dashboard that would benefit from custom visualization (e.g., a specific conversion funnel, detailed breakdown of a custom event by multiple properties).
            17.2.3.2.2. [ ] : Choose a suitable charting library (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js) compatible with Next.js for rendering visualizations.
            17.2.3.2.3. [ ] : Sketch the layout of the custom report/dashboard page.
        17.2.3.3. [ ] : (Potentially Post-MVP) Develop a basic custom report page within the Next.js application. (Risk: 6/10) (Complexity: 6/10 for initial custom report)

                17.2.3.3.1.1. [ ] : Store Plausible API key securely (e.g., environment variable, not exposed client-side).
                17.2.3.3.1.2. [ ] : Construct API requests to Plausible based on the KPIs to be visualized (e.g., specific metrics, filters, time periods).
                17.2.3.3.1.3. [ ] : Handle API responses, including error states.
            17.2.3.3.2. [ ] : Create a client-side React component (or use a Server Component if rendering static charts) to display the fetched data using the chosen charting library.
            17.2.3.3.3. [ ] : Pass data fetched server-side (or via client-side call to the Next.js API route) to the charting components.
            17.2.3.3.4. [ ] : Implement basic UI for the report page (e.g., title, date range selector if applicable, chart containers).
        17.2.3.4. [ ] : Ensure any custom dashboard adheres to data visualization best practices (clarity, simplicity, appropriate chart types for the data, clear labels and legends, accessibility considerations). (Risk: 3/10) (Complexity: 2/10)
